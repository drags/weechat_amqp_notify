# Weechat AMQP Notify

Generate libnotify or Growl notifications from the messages generated by Weechat's [amqp_notify.py](http://www.weechat.org/scripts/source/amqp_notify.rb.html/) script.

Currently expects a durably bound queue. Will improve to manage own durable queue in future.

The script will auto-reconnect to lost AMQP connections. Maintain a tunnel to a remote AMQP server by running the following in a screen/tmux session:

	LOCAL_RABBIT_PORT="5672"
	REMOTE_RABBIT_HOST="my-shell-box"
	REMOTE_RABBIT_PORT="5672"
	while [ 1 ]; do
		ssh -C -L ${LOCAL_RABBIT_PORT}:localhost:${REMOTE_RABBIT_PORT} $REMOTE_RABBIT_HOST
	done
